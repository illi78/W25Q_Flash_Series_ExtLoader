When setting the stop PHY clock bit in the clock gating control register, most of the 48 MHz clock domain internal to the OTG full-speed core is switched off by clock gating. The dynamic power consumption due to the USB clock switching activity is cut ev
en if the 48 MHz clock input is kept running by the application Most of the transceiver is also disabled, and only the part in charge of detecting the asynchronous resume or remote wakeup event is kept alive.
